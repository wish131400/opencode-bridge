# Reliability Guide

**Version**: v2.9.5-beta
**Last Updated**: 2026-03-23

---

## 1. Overview

OpenCode Bridge includes comprehensive reliability mechanisms to ensure stable operation:

| Mechanism | Purpose | Default State |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **Heartbeat Engine** | Periodic OpenCode health probing | Disabled |
| **Cron Scheduler** | Scheduled task management | Enabled |
| **Rescue Orchestrator** | Auto-repair OpenCode failures | Enabled (loopback only) |
| **Session Keepalive** | Keep sessions active | Enabled |

---

## 2. Default Behavior

Starting the bridge service automatically initializes the reliability lifecycle:

### Built-in Cron Tasks

| Task Name | Schedule | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `watchdog-probe` | Every 30 seconds | OpenCode health probe |
| `process-consistency-check` | Every 60 seconds | Process consistency check |
| `stale-cleanup` | Every 5 minutes | Cleanup expired resources |
| `budget-reset` | Daily at 0:00 | Reset rescue budget |

### Proactive Heartbeat

**Disabled by default** (`RELIABILITY_PROACTIVE_HEARTBEAT_ENABLED=false`).

When enabled, triggered by Bridge timer, independent of platform inbound messages.

---

## 3. Runtime Cron Dynamic Management

### Management Entry Points

| Entry | Format | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **HTTP API** | `/cron/list|add|update|remove` | Manage via REST API |
| **Feishu** | `/cron ...` | Manage via command in Feishu |
| **Discord** | `///cron ...` | Manage via command in Discord |
| **Web Panel** | `http://localhost:4098` | Visual management in browser |

---

### Default Behavior

Cron tasks bind to "the chat window that created it + the OpenCode session bound at that time":

1. Execution prioritizes the original OpenCode session
2. Results are pushed back to the original chat window
3. If original window invalid, forwarding depends on configuration

---

### Natural Language Parsing

Support natural language Cron creation:

```text
/cron add a scheduled task to send me an AI briefing every morning at 8
///cron generate AI briefing, remember to send on weekdays
/cron pause task <jobId>
```

---

### API Examples

```bash
# List tasks
curl http://127.0.0.1:4097/cron/list

# Add task
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4097/cron/add \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "daily-check",
    "schedule": { "kind": "cron", "expr": "0 * * * * *" },
    "payload": {
      "kind": "systemEvent",
      "text": "Execute routine check",
      "sessionId": "ses_xxx",
      "delivery": {
        "platform": "feishu",
        "conversationId": "oc_xxx"
      }
    },
    "enabled": true
  }'

# Update task (disable)
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4097/cron/update \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "id": "<job-id>", "enabled": false }'

# Delete task
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4097/cron/remove \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "id": "<job-id>" }'
```

---

### Authentication

If `RELIABILITY_CRON_API_TOKEN` is configured, requests must include:

```bash
-H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

---

```

---

## 5. Heartbeat Usage Guide

### Enable Heartbeat

Set `RELIABILITY_PROACTIVE_HEARTBEAT_ENABLED=true` and restart service.

### Heartbeat Flow

```
1. Bridge timer triggers per RELIABILITY_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS
       ↓
2. Send heartbeat prompt to Agent Session
       ↓
3. Agent reads HEARTBEAT.md and executes checks
       ↓
4. Check results:
   ├── No issues: Reply "HEARTBEAT_OK"
   └── Issues found: Return alert text
       └─> Can push to RELIABILITY_HEARTBEAT_ALERT_CHATS
```

---

### HEARTBEAT.md Format

```markdown
- [ ] failure_type: Description  # Enabled check item
- [x] failure_type: Description  # Disabled check item
```

### State Files

- **Heartbeat session state**: `memory/heartbeat-session.json`
- **Audit log**: `logs/reliability-audit.jsonl`

---

## 6. Execution Flows

### Cron Execution Flow

```
Bridge Start
    ↓
Load built-in Cron tasks
    ↓
Load persisted jobs.json
    ↓
Register to CronScheduler
    ↓
Trigger per cron expr
    ↓
Check original chat window and session binding
    │
    ├─ Binding valid → Execute in original OpenCode session → Push results to original window
    │
    ├─ Original window invalid, forwarding allowed → Execute and forward to private chat/backup
    │
    └─ Original window invalid, forwarding disabled → Skip or cleanup orphan task
```

---

### Heartbeat Execution Flow

```
Bridge timer every N minutes
    ↓
Send heartbeat prompt to Agent Session
    ↓
Agent reads HEARTBEAT.md
    ↓
Execute checks
    │
    ├─ No issues → Reply HEARTBEAT_OK → Bridge logs silently
    │
    └─ Issues found → Reply alert content → Bridge logs and can push user alerts
```

---

## 7. Auto-Rescue Trigger Conditions

### Trigger Conditions

Health probe continuous failures, and:

- Consecutive failure count `>= RELIABILITY_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`
- Failure window duration `>= RELIABILITY_WINDOW_MS`

---

### Guard Conditions

- Target host is loopback (`localhost/127.0.0.1/::1`)
- Repair budget not exhausted
- Cooldown window passed since last repair

---

### Rescue Flow

```
Rescue triggered
    ↓
Lock and single-instance check
    ↓
Environment diagnosis
    ↓
Config backup and two-level rollback
    ↓
Start OpenCode
    ↓
Health re-check
    ↓
Auto-send recovery context
```

---

## 8. Artifacts and Audit Locations

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `memory/heartbeat-session.json` | Heartbeat session state |
| `logs/reliability-audit.jsonl` | Reliability audit log |
| `<OPENCODE_CONFIG_FILE>.bak.<timestamp>.<sha256>` | Config backup |

---

## 9. Orphan Cron and Fallback Strategy

### RELIABILITY_CRON_ORPHAN_AUTO_CLEANUP=false (default)

- No automatic orphan Cron scan at startup
- No automatic deletion when group dismiss/channel delete
- Task execution skips if binding invalid, logs recorded

---

### RELIABILITY_CRON_ORPHAN_AUTO_CLEANUP=true

- Scan and delete orphan Crons missing original window binding or session at startup
- Delete Crons bound to group when group dismiss or channel delete
- `stale-cleanup` periodic task continues scanning orphan Crons

---

### RELIABILITY_CRON_FORWARD_TO_PRIVATE=true

When original chat window invalid but original session still executable and not bound to other active windows:

- Can forward results to private chat/backup window
- Fallback target priority: task explicit fallback > env fallback id > same platform creator private chat

---

## 10. Common Self-Check Commands

```bash
# Check OpenCode local environment
node scripts/deploy.mjs opencode-check

# Verify reliability startup/cleanup flow
npm test -- tests/reliability-bootstrap.test.ts

# Verify rescue end-to-end scenario
npm test -- tests/reliability-rescue.e2e.test.ts
```

## 12. Troubleshooting

### Heartbeat Not Executing

1. Check `RELIABILITY_PROACTIVE_HEARTBEAT_ENABLED` is `true`
2. Verify `HEARTBEAT.md` check items are marked as `- [ ]`
3. Check `memory/heartbeat-state.json` for `lastRunAt` updates

### Auto-Rescue Not Triggering

1. Verify `OPENCODE_HOST` is loopback address
2. Check `RELIABILITY_LOOPBACK_ONLY` is `true`
3. Confirm failure count/window thresholds are met
4. Check `logs/reliability-audit.jsonl` for rejection reasons

### Cron Tasks Not Executing

1. Check `RELIABILITY_CRON_ENABLED` is `true`
2. Verify task is enabled in Web panel
3. Check task binding (session/channel) is still valid
4. Review `logs/service.log` for execution errors

### Missing Backup Config

1. Check `logs/reliability-audit.jsonl` for `backupPath`
2. Verify `OPENCODE_CONFIG_FILE` path is correct
3. Ensure write permissions for backup directory

---

## 13. Best Practices

### Production Deployment

1. **Enable reliability features**: Cron and rescue are essential for production
2. **Configure alerts**: Set `RELIABILITY_HEARTBEAT_ALERT_CHATS` for notifications
3. **Monitor logs**: Regularly review `logs/reliability-audit.jsonl`
4. **Test rescue**: Periodically verify rescue flow works

### Development Environment

1. **Disable auto-rescue**: Set `RELIABILITY_LOOPBACK_ONLY=false` if testing remote OpenCode
2. **Reduce thresholds**: Lower `RELIABILITY_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` for faster testing
3. **Enable dual mode**: Use `ROUTER_MODE=dual` for gray testing new features

### Backup Strategy

1. **Regular backups**: Backup `data/config.db` periodically
2. **Config versioning**: Keep `opencode.json` under version control
3. **Test recovery**: Periodically verify backup restoration works
